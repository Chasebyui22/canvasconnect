        <h2>Canvas Connect</h2>
        <p>Our campus is full of talented students and dedicated staff, and we want 
            to make it easier for everyone to connect. That's why we created an app
            that lets you instantly find and connect with classmates on LinkedIn. 
            With just a click of a button, you can access the LinkedIn profiles 
            of everyone in your class, making networking faster and more convenient
            than ever. Whether you're looking to grow your LinkedIn connections or
            find teammates for a project, our app makes it simple. It's a tool 
            designed to help all of us make the most of the amazing community 
            we're a part of.
